In this section we will outline the installation steps for installing the software package on a MacOS device. The software package works on both Intel and ARM, with the installation stages being identical.

The first stage is installing a version of Python 3.9, if you don't have a working version. We suggest installing a working Anaconda distribution from https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#macos following the instructions on that page.
