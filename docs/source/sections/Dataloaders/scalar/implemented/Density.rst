Density Dataloader
******************

Density values were taken from the paper 'Thickness distribution of Antarctic sea ice'
(Worby, A.P. et al.). This paper took a density model from the paper 'Structure, principal 
properties and strength of Antarctic sea ice' (Buynitskiy, V.K.). 

Data is generated using the values from this paper, and so no data file is available for download.
