IceNet is a seasonal sea ice forecasting tool being developed by researchers
at the British Antarctic Survey. From the website:

   IceNet is a probabilistic, deep learning sea ice forecasting system 
   developed by an international team and led by British Antarctic Survey 
   and The Alan Turing Institute [Andersson et al., 2021]. IceNet has been 
   trained on climate simulations and observational data to forecast the 
   next 6 months of monthly-averaged sea ice concentration maps.

Data for IceNet V1 is available from `here <https://ramadda.data.bas.ac.uk/repository/entry/show>`_
Data for IceNet V2 is not publically available.
