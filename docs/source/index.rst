Welcome to the PolarRoute Manual Pages
======================================

PolarRoute is a tool for the optimisation of routes for maritime vehicles travelling in polar waters.
This software package has been developed by the **British Antarctic Survey** (BAS), primarily 
for the optimisation of polar routes for the BAS research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough, 
though it is applicable to any vessel (e.g. AUVs). The software is written in Python and is open source.

For more information on the project, please visit the [PolarRoute website](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/autonomous-marine-operations-planning/) 
and follow our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/antarctica/PolarRoute)
