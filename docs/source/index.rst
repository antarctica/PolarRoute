Welcome to the PolarRoute Manual Pages
======================================

PolarRoute is a tool for the optimisation of routes for maritime vehicles travelling in polar waters.
It depends on `MeshiPhi <https://github.com/antarctica/MeshiPhi>`_; a package designed to
discretise the world from heterogeneous data sources (follow link for more details and docs).
This software package has been developed by the **British Antarctic Survey** (BAS). It was originally designed primarily for the
optimisation of polar routes for the BAS research vessel RRS Sir David Attenborough, however it is applicable
to any vessel (e.g. AUVs). The software is written in Python and is open source.

Plotting functionality for the outputs of PolarRoute is provided by the `GeoPlot <https://github.com/antarctica/GeoPlot>`_ package, also developed at BAS.

For more information on the project, please visit the `PolarRoute website <https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/autonomous-marine-operations-planning/>`_
and follow our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/antarctica/PolarRoute>`_.
