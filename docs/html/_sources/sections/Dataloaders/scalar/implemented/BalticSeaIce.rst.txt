Baltic sea ice concentration values are provided by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).
From their webpage:

   The operational sea ice service at FMI provides ice parameters over the Baltic Sea. 
   The parameters are based on ice chart produced on daily basis during the 
   Baltic Sea ice season and show the ice concentration in a 1 km grid.
